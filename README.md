## Reading the tutorial

We suggest reading [the tutorial on GitBook](https://dcoded.gitbook.io/chem), as it's much easier to navigate between tutorials<!--, or PyBook for access to the notes offline-->.

<!-- [Download the PyBook course here](wiki/PyBookCourse.md). You can learn more about PyBook [here](https://github.com/dylanopen/PyBook). -->
