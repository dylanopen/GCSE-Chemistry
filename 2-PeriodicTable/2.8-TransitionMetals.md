# Lesson 2.8 Transition Metal Properties

## Transition metals

The transition metals are found near the *middle* of the periodic table.

They are found in-between the 'grouped' metals and the non-metals.

## Physical properties

The transition metals usually have the following properties:

* Good thermal conductor
* Good electrical conductor
* Malleable (can be bent)
* High melting point
* High boiling point
* Hard
* Tough
* High density

## Atomic properties

Many transition metals can form ions of different charges.

They sometimes form coloured compounds.

They are very useful as catalysts in chemical reactions.
