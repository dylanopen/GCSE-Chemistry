# Lesson 2.5 - Group 0

## Noble gases

Group 0 is called the 'Noble Gases'.

They get this name because they do not react with any other substances.

They are all gases at room temperature (hence the name).

## Reactivity

Group 0 elements do not react.

This means they do not form compounds with other elements.

They also rarely bond together to form molecules.

## Outer shell

The noble gases (Group 0) do not react because they have a full outer shell.

As they are in Group 0, they do not need to gain or lose electrons.

They are already stable, so do not need to form bonds and alter their electronic structure.

> You need to remember that the noble gases are **stable** - because they have full outer electron shells!

## Properties

The melting and boiling points of Group 0 elements **increase** going down the group.

This means that atoms with higher atomic numbers have higher melting and boiling points.
