# Lesson 2.4 - Metals And Non-Metals

## Grouping elements

While elements are usually grouped based on their Group and Period, we can also group the elements based on their properties.

There are two types of elements - metals and non-metals

## Metals

The majority of elements are metals.

Metals are found towards the bottom-left of the periodic table.

They form **metallic** bonds with other metals, or **ionic** bonds with non-metals.

## Properties of metals

Metals are almost always solids (at room temperature).  
The only exception is mercury - a liquid.

They form positive ionic bonds when reacting.

They have fewer outer electrons, and thus *lose* electrons to become stable.

## Non-metals

Non-metals are found towards the upper-left of the periodic table.

They form **covalent** bonds with other non-metals, and also **ionic** bonds with metals.

## Properties of non-metals

Non-metals can be either solid, liquid, or gas.

They do not form positive ions during chemical reactions.

They have many outer electrons, and therefore *gain* electrons to become stable.
