# Lesson 2.2 - Element Patterns

## Patterns in the periodic table

The periodic table has many patterns.

In this lesson, we will learn about how we can predict the properties of elements, using the periodic table.

## Electron shells

The number of electron shells is the same as the **period** of the element.

Carbon (C) is in Period 2, and so has 2 electron shells.

Krypton (K) is in Period 4, and so has 4 electron shells.

> Note: The outer shell may not be full. Carbon has 2 total shells, but only the first is full.

## Outer electrons

The number of electrons in the outer shell is determined by the **group** of the element.

The number of outer electrons is almost always the same as the group.

The exception: Group 0 has a full outer shell (usually 8 electrons).

|  Element  | Group | Outer electrons
| --------- | ----- | --------------- |
| Oxygen    |   6   |        6        |
| Carbon    |   4   |        4        |
| Sodium    |   1   |        1        |
| Fluorine  |   7   |        7        |
| Argon     |   0   |        8        |
