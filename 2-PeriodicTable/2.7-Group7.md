# Lesson 2.7 - Group 7

## Halogens

The elements in Group 7 are known as the 'Halogens'.

Halogens are non-metals - some are liquid, some are gas.

They bond **covalently** in pairs.

## Electronic structure

The halogens have 7 electrons in their outer shell.

This means they need to **gain** 1 electron to become stable.

This means they react with metals, particularly Group 1 metals (as they give away 1 electron).

## Reactivity

Group 7 halogens react with metals to form **ionic** bonds. This is where they *transfer* electrons.

They also bond with non-metals to form **covalent** bonds. In these bonds, electrons are *shared*.

## Patterns

The melting and boiling point *increase* going down the group.

The reactivity *decreases* going down the group.
