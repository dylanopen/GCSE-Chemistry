# Lesson 2.5 - Group 1

## Alkali metals

Group 1 is called the **alkali metals**.

This is because they form alkalines when reacting with water.

## Reactivity

Group 1 elements are **very** reactive.

They vigorously react with any non-metal (such as water or oxygen).

## Electronic structure

The Group 1 elements have 1 outer electron.

This means they need to lose that electron to become stable.

They do this by 'giving' the electron to a non-metal.

## Patterns

The reactivity **increases** going down the group.

This means that, for instance, potassium (K) is more reactive than lithium (Li).
