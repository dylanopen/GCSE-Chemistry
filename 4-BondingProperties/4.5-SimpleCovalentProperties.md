# Lesson 4.5 - Simple Covalent Properties

## States of matter

Simple covalent molecules are usually liquids or gases.

They are rarely solids, due to their low melting point.

## Melting and boiling point

Simple covalent molecules typically have low melting and boiling points.

This is because the **intermolecular forces** (between molecules) are weak.

The molecules can therefore be seperated easily.

> Note: When melting or boiling, the intermolecular forces are broken.  
> The bonds inside each molecule are not broken.

## Size of molecules

The strength of intermolecular forces increases with the size of the molecule.

This means that larger molecules have stronger forces, and therefore also a higher melting and boiling point.

## Conductivity

Simple covalent compounds do not conduct electricity.

This is because there are no delocalised electrons, and the molecules have no overall charge.
