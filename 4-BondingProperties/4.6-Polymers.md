# Lesson 4.6 - Polymers

## Molecules in polymers

*Polymers* contain very large molecules.

They are linked together with **strong covalent bonds**.

## Intermolecular forces

The intermolecular forces in polymers are fairly strong.

Polymers are made up of many **monomers** - joined together in a chain.

## Melting and boiling point

The melting and boiling point of polymers are fairly high.

This means they are usually solids at room temperature.
