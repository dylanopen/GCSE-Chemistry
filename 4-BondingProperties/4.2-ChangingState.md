# Lesson 4.2 - Changing State

## Changes of state

There are 4 main changes of state:

* Melting
* Boiling
* Freezing
* Condensing

There are two, less common state changes:

* Sublimation
* Deposition

## Melting

Melting is where a **solid** turns into a **liquid**.

> solid -> liquid

The substance *gains energy*.

The bonds are weakened slightly.

## Boiling

Boiling is where a **liquid** turns into a **gas**.

> liquid -> gas

The substance *gains energy*.

The bonds are weakened more.

## Freezing

Freezing is where a **liquid** turns into a **solid**.

> liquid -> solid

The substance *loses energy*.

The bonds are strengthened.

## Condensing

Condensing (or 'condensation') is where a **gas** turns into a **liquid**.

> gas -> liquid

The substance *loses energy*.

The bonds are strengthened slightly.

## Sublimation

During sublimation, a **solid** *directly* turns into a **gas**.

> solid -> gas

The substance does not turn into a liquid in between.

## Sublimation

Deposition is where a **gas** *directly* turns into a **solid**.

> gas -> solid

The substance does not turn into a liquid in between.

## Melting point

The melting point is the point at which a substance **melts** or **freezes**.

A substance melts when its temperature is higher than its melting point.

A substance freezes when its temperature is lower than its melting point.

## Boiling point

The boiling point is the point at which a substance **boils** or **condenses**.

A substance boils when its temperature is higher than its boiling point.

A substance condenses when its temperature is lower than its boiling point.

## Summary

| State change | From   | To     | Energy is... | Bonds are... |
|--------------|--------|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Melting      | Solid  | Liquid | Gained       | Weakened     |
| Boiling      | Liquid | Gas    | Gained       | Weakened     |
| Freezing     | Liquid | Liquid | Lost         | Strengthened |
| Boiling      | Liquid | Gas    | Lost         | Strengthened |
| Freezing     | Solid  | Gas    | Gained       | Weakened     |
| Deposition   | Gas    | Liquid | Lost         | Strengthened |
