# Lesson 4.7 - Giant Covalent Structures

## Bonding

The bonding in *giant covalent* structures is very strong.

Atoms in the structure are linked together by extremely strong *covalent* bonds.

## Melting and boiling point

The melting and boiling points of giant covalent structures are **very** high.

This is because of the very strong covalent bonds between molecules.

A lot of energy is therefore needed to overcome these strong bonds.

This means that giant covalent structures are *solids* at room temperature.

## Types of giant covalent structure

There are many types of giant covalent structures.

Common ones include:

* Diamond
* Graphite
* Graphene
* Silica

These are all types of giant covalent structures.
