# Lesson 4.3 - State Symbols

## What are state symbols?

State symbols allow us to determine the **state of matter** of a compound in a reaction.

They tell us which state each reactant and product is.

## Solids

The state symbol for solids is **`(s)`**.

For example, the below formula shows that silicon dioxide (sand) is a solid:

> SiO<sub>2</sub> **(s)**

## Liquids

The state symbol for solids is **`(l)`**.

The below formula shows that H<sub>2</sub>0 (water) is a liquid:

> H<sub>2</sub>0 **(l)**

## Gases

The state symbol for gases is **`(g)`**.

This formula shows that carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is a gas:

> CO<sub>2</sub> **(g)**

## Aqueous

The state symbol for aqueous substances is **`(aq)`**.

## State symbols in chemical reactions

State symbols are commonly used in chemical reactions to show the state of each compound in the reaction.

For example (not balanced):

> K **(s)** + O<sub>2</sub> **(g)** --> K<sub>2</sub>O **(s)**
