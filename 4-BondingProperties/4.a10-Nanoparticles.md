# Lesson 4.10 - Nanoparticles

## Nanoscience

Nanoscience involves studying structures under `100nm` in size.

They are usually composed of a few hundred atoms.

## Nanoparticles

A nanoparticle is smaller than a *fine* particle.

They have a high **surface area to volume ratio**.

## Surface area

The surface area to volume ratio increases proportionately with the length of the side of the particle.

## Properties

Nanoparticles have different properties to non-nano particles, even if they contain the same element(s).

This is because of the high surface area to volume ratio.
