# Lesson 4.4 - Ionic Compound Properties

## Lattices

Ionic compounds have a regular structure.

They form a large ionic structure, called a **lattice**.

## Forces

There are strong electrostatic forces between oppositely charged ions.

These opposite charges attract and act in all directions.

## Melting and boiling point

Ionic lattices have high melting and boiling points.

This is because they have very strong bonds - a lot of energy (heat) is needed to break the bonds.

## Conductivity

Ionic compounds do not typically conduct electricity.

However, when dissolved or melted in water, they can conduct electricity.

This is because the ions are free to move and carry charge.
