# Lesson 4.1 - States Of Matter

## 3 states of matter

There are 3 main states of matter:

* Solid
* Liquid
* Gas

## Solids

In a solid, the particles:

* Are very close together (touching)
* Are arranged in a regular pattern
* Vibrate around a fixed point
* Cannot move or slide past each other

Solids cannot be compressed.

They expand when heated.

## Liquids

In a liquid, the particles:

* Are very close together (touching)
* Are not arranged in a pattern ('random')
* Can slide past each other
* Cannot completely move freely (only slide past other particles)

Liquids also cannot be compressed.

## Gases

In a gas, the particles:

* Are far apart from each other
* Are 'all over the place' (no pattern)
* Can move about freely

Gases can be compressed. They are the only state of matter that has this property.

## Particle theory

The states of matter (as well as state conversion) can be understood using **particle theory**.

This is an area of chemistry / physics that looks as how particles interact in the way that they do.

In this topic, we will explore particle physics and how it relates to chemistry.
