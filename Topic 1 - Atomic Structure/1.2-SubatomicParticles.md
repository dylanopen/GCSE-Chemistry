## Types of subatomic particles

There are three main subatomic particles:

* Protons
* Neutrons
* Electrons

## Protons

Protons are positively charged (+1).

They are found in the nucleus.

Their relative atomic mass is `1`.

## Neutrons

Neutrons have no charge (0).

They are also found in the nucleus.

Their relative atomic mass is also `1`.

## Electrons

Electrons have a negative charge (-1).

They are found in 'shells' orbiting around the nucleus.

They have a **very** small atomic mass (but not 0).

## Summary

The table below summarises the different subatomic particles:

| Name     | Where?  | Charge | Mass       |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Proton   | Nucleus | +1     | 1          |
| Neutron  | Nucleus | 0      | 1          |
| Electron | Shells  | -1     | Very small |
