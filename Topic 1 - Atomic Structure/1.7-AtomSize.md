# Lesson 1.7 - Size Of Atoms

In this lesson:

* [Size of an atom](#size-of-an-atom)
* [Nucleus size](#nucleus-size)
* [Nucleus mass](#nucleus-mass)
* [Atomic mass](#atomic-mass)
* [Atomic mass table](#atomic-mass-table)

## Size of an atom

Atoms are **very** small.

They have a radius of about 0.1 nm (1x10<sup>-10</sup>m).

## Nucleus size

The radius of the nucleus only makes up 1/10,000 of the atom!

It therefore has a radius of about 1x10<sup>-14</sup>m! (That's 0.01 pico-metres!)

## Nucleus mass

While the nucleus is tiny in comparison to an atom, it makes up almost all of the mass!

The atomic mass of electrons is very small - much less than that of a proton or neutron.

## Atomic mass

The atomic mass is calculated as follows:

> Atomic mass = number of protons + number of neutrons

Electrons are usually ignored because they are so small.

## Atomic mass table

| Particle | Atomic mass |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Proton   | 1           |
| Neutron  | 1           |
| Electron | Very small  |
