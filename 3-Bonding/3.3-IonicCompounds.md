# Lesson 3.3 - Ionic Compounds

## Lattices

An ionic compound is a giant structure of ions.

We call this structure a **lattice**.

## Forces

Ionic compounds are held together by very strong *electrostatic* forces.

These forces act between *oppositely charged ions*.

They act in all directions.

## Representing ionic compounds

We can represent ionic compounds in many ways.

For example, we can use a:

* Ball and stick diagram
* Dot and cross diagram
* 2D diagram
* 3D diagram

Each have benefits and limitations.
