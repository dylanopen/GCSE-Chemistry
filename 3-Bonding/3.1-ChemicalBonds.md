# Lesson 3.1 - Chemical Bonds

## Types of bond

There are three types of chemical bonds:

* Ionic
* Covalent
* Metallic

The type of bond depends on the elements involved in the reaction.

## Ionic bonding

Ionic bonding is between a *metal* and a *non-metal*.

An ionic bond is formed when electrons are *transferred* (from the metal to the non-metal).

The metal becomes a **positive ion**, and the non-metal becomes a **negative ion**.

## Covalent bonding

Covalent bonding is between two *non-metals*.

It is formed when electrons are *shared*.

## Metallic bonding

Metallic bonding is between two *metals*.

The electrons in a metallic bond are *delocalised*.

## Overview

| Bond     | Elements              | Electrons   |
|----------|-----------------------|-------------|
| Ionic    | metal + non-metal     | transferred |
| Covalent | non-metal + non-metal | shared      |
| Metallic | metal + non-metal     | delocalised |
