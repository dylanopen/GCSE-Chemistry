# Lesson 3.2 - Ionic Bonding

## Forming ionic bonds

As stated in the last lesson, ionic bonds are formed when a metal reacts with a non-metal.

Ionic bonds produce... well... ions.

## Ions

An ion is an atom that has lost or gained electrons.

In other words, ions are atoms that have a charge - either positive or negative.

In ionic bonding, a positive metal ion and negative non-metal ion is produced.

## Electron transfer

During ionic bonding, the outer electron(s) from the metal atom are transfered to the non-metal atom.

As the metal loses (negative) electrons, it becomes a **positive** ion.

The non-metal gains (negative) electrons, and so becomes a **negative** ion.

After the bond, the ions now have a full outer shell each (stable).
