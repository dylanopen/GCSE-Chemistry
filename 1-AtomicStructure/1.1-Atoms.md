## Atoms

An atom is “the smallest part of an element that can exist”.

It is the basis for elements and compounds, that it - everything is made up of atoms.

They contain three subatomic particles.

## Subatomic particles

Atoms contain 3 things:

* Protons
* Neutrons
* Electrons

These three things are called subatomic particles - they are the building block of atoms.

## Making elements

An element is a type of atom.

The element is determined by the number of protons in an atom.

## Nucleus

Atoms contain a dense core - this is called the **nucleus**.

The nucleus contains the **protons** and **neutrons**.

## Electron shells

The electrons orbit around the nucleus in their own **energy levels**.

We call these 'shells'.

The number of shells depends on the number of electrons the atom contains.
