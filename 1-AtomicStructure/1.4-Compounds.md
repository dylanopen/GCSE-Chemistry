## What is a compound?

A compound is a substance made up of more than 1 type of atom (element).

They are formed during chemical reactions.

They are in **fixed proportions** (e.g. in water, for every oxygen, there are always 2 hydrogens, H<sub>2</sub>O).

## Forming compounds

Compounds are formed during chemical reactions.

They are the product of reactants.

The molecules chemically bond together during the reaction.

## Separating compounds

Once formed, a compound cannot easily be separated.

A chemical reaction is required in order to separate the different molecules.

## Compound formulae

We can represent compounds using a chemical formula.

Water, for instance, is made of 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom.

We can represent water using this formula:

> H<sub>2</sub>O
